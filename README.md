## 📝 About

Jab! is a hyper-casual mobile game.  
You play as a boxer and fight opponents, each crazier than the last.

## 🏎️ Main feature

I was lucky enough to be able to develop a visual scripting tool in pair-programming to program the enemies inside the game.  
With the graphic use of a behaviour tree, the designers could add new behaviours to our bosses that we had previously developed in relation to the established rules.
